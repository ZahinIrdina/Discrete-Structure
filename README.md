Discrete Structure 2024/2025

This course provides me with the fundamental in mathematical principles behind computer science and algorithms. The topics include set theory and logic, relations and functions, counting and probability, graph theory and finite automata. I am able to relate all the things that I have learned during this course with other courses that I learnt in this programme. In the near future, I hope that this course can provide the students with more exercises as it will help the students to gain deeper understanding.
